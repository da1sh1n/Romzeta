/// Shared by `sign` and `verify` — and by `release`, which signs and then
/// verifies the same four files — so none of them can disagree about what a
/// file is supposed to be.

// ========== Signing ==========

/// Signs the file at `path` in place with `key`, writing `comment` and today's
/// date into the trusted comment.

/// exe twice replaces its signature instead of burying the old one inside the
/// new signed payload.

    // old block folded into what the new signature covers.
