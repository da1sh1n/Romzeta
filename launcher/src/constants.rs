use std::time::Duration;

// ── Window size (window.rs) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each cover wants to be its own native size. The window then wraps a row of
// them: one margin on every side and nothing else. The cover row's top edge is
// `border_gap` from the top of the window, its bottom edge `border_gap` from
// the bottom, its sides `border_gap` from the sides.
//
// The toolbar and the name line take no height of their own — they sit INSIDE
// the top and bottom margins, pinned to the window rather than to the covers.
// That is what makes the row's box symmetric, and it makes `border_gap` the one
// knob for every piece of spacing in the window. See src/style.css, which
// places both of them.
//
// How many games there are decides how WIDE the window is, and nothing else.
// The row holds every game up to what MAX_WIDTH_FRACTION of the screen allows,
// and never fewer than MIN_VISIBLE_COVERS; past that the page scrolls the row
// sideways. A long catalog therefore costs scrolling, not cover size — the
// covers a player can see are always the size they were meant to be.
//
// A cover only shrinks for the screen: MAX_HEIGHT_FRACTION when the display is
// too short for one at native size, and the MIN_VISIBLE_COVERS floor when it is
// too narrow for three. Whichever bites hardest sets a single scale (≤1) applied
// to every cover on both axes. The CSS in src/style.css reproduces the same
// fit independently, from the window height alone, scaling covers DOWN only.
//
// There used to be an IMAGE_WIDTH_FRACTION here — each cover asked for a
// fraction of the screen width, capped at native. It is gone because it was
// almost always the binding constraint rather than the cap: at 0.16 a 2560px
// display asked for 410px of a 600px cover, so the art was never once shown at
// the size it was drawn at, on any display, and the "shrinks only for the
// screen" rule above was not true.

/// The cover row may not exceed this × screen width.
pub const MAX_WIDTH_FRACTION: f64 = 0.90;
/// The window may not exceed this × screen height.
pub const MAX_HEIGHT_FRACTION: f64 = 0.80;

/// The window is never narrower than this many covers, however few games the
/// cartridge holds — so zero, one and two games all open the same window, and
/// there is always room for the toolbar across the top of it. A screen too
/// narrow to hold this many at target size shrinks the covers until it can.
pub const MIN_VISIBLE_COVERS: f64 = 3.0;

// ── Look and feel (config.rs) ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Fallbacks for the knobs exposed in config.toml, used when a key is absent or
// unusable. They match the values baked into src/style.css, so both sides of
// the page agree without talking to each other. The seed in src/config.toml is
// free to ship different values — these are the floor under a config that
// doesn't mention a setting at all, not the house style. The two spacing values
// (border gap around the covers and gap between them) are also used by the
// window-sizing math and mirrored as PAD/GAP in src/theme.js, so the computed
// size and the CSS layout agree.
//
// DEFAULT_BORDER_GAP is 56 rather than the 36 it was, because the margin now
// has to hold the toolbar above the covers and the name line below them. The
// bottom furniture takes a fixed 42px, so a gap under 42 puts the name line on
// the art and one under 30 puts the toolbar on it. Nothing clamps that — a
// cartridge is free to ask for a layout that doesn't work.

// ── The palette: 60 / 30 / 10 ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three colors carry the whole launcher, in the proportions the rule is named
// for. Everything that is not cover art, and not one of the two semantic
// states below, is one of these or a shade worked out from them.
//
//   primary    60%  the window behind everything
//   secondary  30%  shadows, borders, the plate behind missing art
//   accent     10%  text, the selected cover, the close button
//
// Two shades are derived rather than used raw, and both for measured reasons —
// see the ramp in src/app.js. The accent at full strength is a fine FILL (the
// close square, the active order segment) but fails WCAG AA as body text on a
// dark primary; text therefore uses it lifted toward the light. Secondary at
// full strength is nearly invisible as a hairline on primary, so borders use it
// lifted toward the accent. Set the three, get a coherent launcher.

/// choose for us. Windows 11 rounds the window itself and picks its own radius;

// straight into primary and secondary when a cartridge still names them — so
// they need no fallback of their own, and giving them one would make "unset"
// indistinguishable from "set to the old value".

// The launch states: a game that failed to start (border + message under its
// cover, still clickable to retry), a game whose exe isn't on the cartridge at

//
// Blank means "work it out from the three above" — the toolbar from the accent,
