/// *Two* target directories, because the crate builds both ways: standalone its
/// artifacts land in `listener/target/`, and inside the workspace in the shared
/// `../target/`. Checking only the first would make a workspace `cargo run`
/// look deployed and silently write its log into `target/debug/`.
