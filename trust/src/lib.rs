// ########## THE TRUST DECISION ##########

// ========== What A Build Accepts ==========

/// One public key a build will accept, plus a name for it so the log can say
/// which one let a binary through.
///
/// The fields are borrowed: the shipped programs get theirs from a `const`
/// their build script generated (see `listener/build.rs`). There is no runtime
/// path for loading an anchor.
pub struct Anchor<'a> {
    pub name: &'a str,
    pub base64: &'a str,
}

impl Anchor<'_> {
    /// Whether this anchor parses as a key `attest` could actually use.
    /// Lets a program assert its build script produced something usable without
    /// linking a verifier itself — anchors that do not parse would otherwise
    /// refuse every cartridge in existence, one puzzled log line at a time.

        minisign_verify::PublicKey::from_base64(self.base64).is_ok()
    }

// ========== The Two Outcomes ==========

/// What a verified signature says about the binary it came from. Every field is
/// covered by a signature that has already been checked, so unlike anything else
/// about a file off a stranger's disk it is safe to believe.

    /// not have to remember what it passed in.

/// asked for. Nothing in the file means anything until the first one passes.
