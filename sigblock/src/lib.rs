// ========== Reading ==========

/// Splits a signed binary into `(signed bytes, signature text)`.
/// Anything that is not a well-formed block comes back as `(bytes, None)` —
/// there is no `Result` here, because a truncated file, a bogus length and no
/// block at all all mean the same thing to every caller, and this runs against
/// whatever a stranger just plugged into the machine.
pub fn split(bytes: &[u8]) -> (&[u8], Option<&str>) {
    let unsigned = (bytes, None);

    // `checked_sub` rather than `-`: a file shorter than the footer would
    // underflow and panic, and an empty file is an ordinary thing to be handed.
    let Some(footer_at) = bytes.len().checked_sub(FOOTER_LEN) else {
        return unsigned;
    };
    let footer = &bytes[footer_at..];

    // Magic first — it is the cheapest way to reject the overwhelming majority.
    if &footer[6..] != MAGIC {
        return unsigned;
    }
    if u16::from_le_bytes([footer[4], footer[5]]) != FORMAT {
        return unsigned;
    }

    let len = u32::from_le_bytes([footer[0], footer[1], footer[2], footer[3]]);
    // Compared as u64, because `as usize` narrows on a 32-bit target: a length
    // of 2^32 + 8 would wrap to 8 there and sail through the bounds check.

// ========== Writing ==========

/// Builds the file to write from `bytes` and a `signature`.

/// old signature instead of burying it inside the new signed payload — which
/// matters because `cargo build` and `xtask sign` both write the same file.
