**Game cartridge system.** — turn any storage device into a game cartridge that
*just works* when you plug it in.

*Romzeta* — **ROM** + *-zeta*, from the Slovak *kazeta*, "cartridge".

Romzeta is made of three apps:

- **Launcher** — lives *on the cartridge*. A clean, full-screen wall of cover art;
  click a cover to launch the game.
- **Listener** — lives *on your PC*. When you plug in a Romzeta cartridge, it recognizes
  it and starts that cartridge's launcher automatically — like slotting a cartridge into
  a console. On Windows that's a small background app; on Linux nothing runs at all until
  you plug something in. *(Windows build works; Linux not started.)*
- **Installer** — the one file you download. It turns blank media into a cartridge,
  installs the listener, and edits cartridges you already made. Everything else is carried
  inside it: no downloads, no prerequisites. *(Built and tried on real media.)*

All three build and run on Windows. The manual setup below still works and is documented as
the alternative to the installer.

> Developers: each app documents itself — [launcher/structure.md](launcher/structure.md)
> (cartridge side), [listener/structure.md](listener/structure.md) (PC side), and
> [installer/structure.md](installer/structure.md) (setup-side spec).

## Install

### The launcher (cartridge)

1. **Build it**:
   ```sh
   cargo run -p xtask -- release
   ```
   Running `launcher.exe` once creates its content folders beside itself and seeds
   `config.toml` + `catalog.json` if missing.

2. **Add your games** — beside `launcher.exe`:
   - Put each game's install under `games/…`.
   - Put each cover image (600×900, 2:3) under `assets/images/…`.
   - List them in `catalog.json`:
     ```json
     [
       { "name": "Elden Ring", "exe": "games/elden_ring/elden_ring.exe", "image": "assets/images/elden_ring.png" }
     ]
     ```
     Paths are relative to `launcher.exe`'s own folder. Your edits here are **never
     overwritten** by a rebuild.

3. **Ship it** — copy `launcher.exe` and its content folder onto the cartridge (any storage
   device: NVMe, SSD, HDD, USB). They travel together.

### The listener (PC) — *Windows works, Linux not started*

Auto-starts a cartridge's launcher when you plug it in. Windows and Linux, built from one
codebase but working quite differently: on Windows it's a small app running quietly in the
background, on Linux it isn't running at all until the system wakes it on connect.

Until the installer ships, setting it up is manual:

1. `cargo run -p xtask -- keygen` — once, if you have never built this tree. It writes
   `keys/dev.pub`, which the listener compiles in as a key it trusts. Without it the listener
   does not build at all: a listener with nothing to trust would accept nothing.
2. `cargo run -p xtask -- release` — builds the launcher and the listener and **signs** them.
   The signature is what makes a drive a cartridge, so an unsigned launcher is ignored.
3. `target\release\listener.exe --check .` — runs the core once by hand, to confirm it
   works before relying on it.
4. Copy the signed `launcher.exe` to the root of the drive, with its `catalog.json`,
   `config.toml`, `games/` and `assets/images/` beside it.
5. Run `listener.exe` from wherever you placed it. It stays in the background — no window,
   no tray icon — and starts the launcher when you plug the cartridge in. `listener.log`,
   right beside it, says what it did.

There is nothing to pair. The listener accepts a cartridge when the `launcher.exe` at its root
carries a signature from a key that listener was built with, and refuses everything else — so
a drive with a launcher you did not sign does nothing, and there is no list anywhere to keep
in step.

`listener.exe --check E:\` answers "would this cartridge launch?" without plugging anything
in, and `listener.exe --signature` says which keys a given copy trusts. See
[listener/README.md](listener/README.md), [listener/structure.md](listener/structure.md) and
[SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md) for the rest.

### The installer — *built and tried on real media*

The piece that makes all of the above unnecessary: one file that writes the cartridge and
sets up the listener for you. It carries the launcher, the listener and their seed files
inside itself and downloads nothing.

Build it in two steps — it embeds the other two binaries, so they have to exist first:

```sh
cargo build --release               # launcher + listener
cargo build --release -p installer  # embeds what that produced
```

`target/release/installer.exe` then does three things:

- **Make or edit a cartridge** — pick an **external** drive (internal disks and the one
  Windows is on are not offered), choose a key, add game folders (it finds each game's exe for
  you and asks when it can't be sure), pick covers, and copy. A drive that is already a
  cartridge opens for editing instead: add games, remove games, change the key.
- **Set up this PC** — installs the listener to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Romzeta\`, where it keeps its
  config and its log too. Pairs it with your cartridge's key, starts it, and registers it to
  start at login. **Nothing in the installer asks for administrator**, this included.
- **Uninstall** — removes the folder *and* the login entry.

See [installer/structure.md](installer/structure.md) for how it decides all of that.

## Use

1. Plug in the cartridge. With the Windows listener running, that is all you do.
2. Otherwise run `launcher.exe` yourself.
3. The launcher opens full of cover art:
   - **Click a cover** to launch that game.
   - **Click the close button** (top-right) to exit.
4. Tweak the look by editing `config.toml` — background color, spacing, corner rounding,
   card shadow, and whether game titles show under the covers. Blank or invalid values
   fall back to sensible defaults.
