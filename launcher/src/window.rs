/// Rounds the window's corners, by whichever means this Windows has.
///
/// # Why there are two ways
///
/// Windows 11 (build 22000 and up) will do this properly: `DwmSetWindowAttribute`
/// with `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE` asks the compositor for it, and the
/// compositor draws an anti-aliased corner and keeps the window's shadow. On
/// Windows 10 that attribute does not exist and the call comes back
/// `E_INVALIDARG` — so this is not a preference that is off, it is a feature
/// that isn't there.
///
/// The Windows 10 way is to clip the window to a region. It works, and it is
/// what the launcher falls back to, but a GDI region is a **one-bit mask**: a
/// pixel is inside the window or it isn't, and there is no third answer. The
/// corner is therefore a little stair-stepped there, and no amount of care here
/// changes that.
///
/// # Why the page doesn't draw them instead
///
/// It can't. Rounding them in CSS needs the window behind the page to be
/// transparent, and it isn't: wry hosts WebView2 in *windowed* mode, where the
/// browser lives in a child HWND with no per-pixel alpha, so the page composites
/// onto opaque white however the window and the controller are configured.
/// (Measured, not assumed: a page background at 99% opacity comes out as an
/// exact 0.99 blend with white.) True transparency would need composition
/// hosting, which is a different way of embedding the browser altogether.
///
/// A radius of 0 leaves the window square — the region is cleared rather than
/// replaced, so this is also how somebody turns the feature off.
